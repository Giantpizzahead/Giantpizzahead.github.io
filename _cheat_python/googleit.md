Seriously. Use Google, Stack Overflow, Github Copilot, even ChatGPT. They will save you a TON of time!

{% alert note %}
**Github Copilot** is included for free as part of the Github Student Developer Pack.

It's essentially an autocomplete engine for code, and is surprisingly effective when given the right comments. Try it out!
