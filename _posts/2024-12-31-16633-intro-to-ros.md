title: '16.633: Intro to ROS'
---

Supposed to be an introduction to ROS class (part of NEET Autonomous Machines). We didn't really do much though.

The full example project using ROS can be downloaded [here](https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/27384/files/4820594/download?download_frd=1). But in full honesty, I would recommend using GPT to learn ROS on the go - it's quite clunky.
