<p><em>"Don't repeat yourself."</em></p>

<p>This is the guiding philosophy for this section of the site. Answers to all the questions that I've thought of (and bothered to note down) are here. There's no strict format - think of this as a quick-and-dirty Google search, but someone else did the Googling for you.<br>The search tool is powered by <a href="http://elasticlunr.com/">Elasticlunr.js</a>.</p>

<p>Even though this is mainly for personal use - I hope you still find it useful! :)</p>
