## Hair Styles

The best way to find a good hairstyle is to experiment. Nothing will beat experimenting, but of course, you'd need to know what styles to try on first.

A good place to start is to figure out your **face shape**. See [this guide](https://www.realsimple.com/beauty-fashion/what-is-my-face-shape).

A bunch of good hairstyles based on face shapes are in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWSrp00wNBw). Keep it mostly symmetric and it'll look great!

Also, note that Asian hair is straight/hard.

Normal style: When talking to a barber, say 2 on the side, 6 on the top, and scissors in the front (not 8!), with sideburns up to a bit below the frames (even on both sides). This style works good, but experimenting could help you find a better one.

Look at a fade haircut from [Great Clips](https://www.greatclips.com/lookbook/classic-fade-haircut). A low taper fade haircut (yes, the meme) can be considered too.

### Nose Hair

You can use a specialized trimmer, or just use scissors / a comb (but be careful). Or pluck manually, though that only works for long ones.

## Shower

When showering, rinse hair, then apply shampoo, lather (wet a bit then spread it out with hands), rinse, then apply conditioner, brush your teeth or wash your body for 1-2 minutes while letting the conditioner stay, then rinse.

Do NOT use 2-in-one shampoo/conditioner products, they don't work. They will leave your hair dry and prone to dandruff / other undesireable things.

## Laundry

### Business Shirt Folding

Fold work shirts in this way to lower the prevalence of creases.

 - Turn the shirt on its back, lying flat.
 - Fold in both sides to make the width smaller at the end, and put the sleeves on top of the sides. It should be 1/3 the original width now.
 - Then, starting at the bottom, fold twice (each being a third long).
 - Finally, turn the folded shirt over.

## Teeth

Consider using whitening strips to help reverse/clear yellowing teeth. But ask a dentist first to ensure it won't cause complications with other conditions.

An endodontist is a specialist who does root canal-related things.
