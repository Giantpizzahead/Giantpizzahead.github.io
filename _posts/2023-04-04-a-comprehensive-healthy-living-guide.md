## About

### Philosophy

So, to put it plainly... Tracking your health doesn't mean shit if you aren't actively trying to be healthy in the first place. This guide is meant to be a comprehensive guide on how to be healthy. We'll focus on the [major building blocks of a healthy lifestyle](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle), in no particular order:

 - Sleeping well
 - Eating well
 - Staying active (physically)
 - Socializing (and forming genuine bonds)
 - Being mindful (and managing stress)
 - Maintaining yourself (mind and body)
 - Controlling your habits (good and bad)
 - Being proactive (vs. reactive)
 - Forming systems

Note that this isn't just about the basics - eating, sleeping, exercising. We're trying to form a solid foundation from which to build *everything* else on, from being a good student / holding a stable job to clearing up enough time to try something new, and having the systems in place to do that new thing consistently (so not just a new year's resolution). I almost called this "A Guide to Life", but it's not *that* broad and would be impossible to cover in one article. With that being said, this entire wiki together will hopefully be a full guide to life one day... :)

Refer to A Comprehensive Health Tracking Guide, which was written before this one, for details on how we're approaching these guides.

### References

Tons of people have made tons of amazing guides on healthy living already! The tips here are pretty much all summarized from other websites for personal reference / convenience. With that being said, I'll link relevant stuff in each section for attribution and as a more detailed reference.

### Timeliness

This guide was created in April 2023, but this type of advice doesn't really change much. So, this stuff will probably stay relevant for a lifetime :)

## Staying Active

### Purpose

Exercise has [numerous health benefits](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-benefits-of-exercise). No matter who you are, being physically active is an *essential* part of being healthy.

The American Heart Association [recommends](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults):

 - 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise every week (or a combination of both).
 - 2 sessions of muscle-strengthening activity - resistance or weight training - every week.
 - Avoiding long stretches of sitting. Any bit of movement helps!

We'll split this into two types of exercise: *Passive* and *active*. Passive activity is all the stuff you do without really thinking about it - walking/biking for commute purposes, climbing stairs, moving around in your room. Active exercise, on the other hand, is an intense period of activity that you intentionally set aside for working out. Both these types play major roles in getting you the activity needed to stay healthy.
