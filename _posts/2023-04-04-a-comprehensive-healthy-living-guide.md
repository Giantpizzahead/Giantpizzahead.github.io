## About

#### Philosophy

So, to put it plainly... Tracking your health doesn't mean shit if you aren't actively trying to be healthy in the first place. This guide is meant to be a comprehensive guide on how to be healthy. We'll focus on the [major building blocks of a healthy lifestyle](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle), in no particular order:

 - Sleeping well
 - Eating well
 - Staying active (physically)
 - Socializing (and forming genuine bonds)
 - Being mindful (and managing stress)
 - Maintaining yourself (mind and body)
 - Controlling your habits (good and bad)
 - Being proactive (vs. reactive)
 - Forming systems (that last)

Note that this isn't just about the basics - eating, sleeping, exercising. We're trying to form a solid foundation from which to build *everything* else on, from being a good student / holding a stable job to clearing up enough time to try something new, and having the systems in place to do that new thing consistently (so not just a new year's resolution). I almost called this "A Guide to Life", but it's not *that* broad and would be impossible to cover in one article. With that being said, this entire wiki together will hopefully be a full guide to life one day... :)

Refer to A Comprehensive Health Tracking Guide, which was written before this one, for details on how we're approaching these guides.

#### References

Tons of people have made tons of amazing guides on healthy living already! The tips here are pretty much all summarized from other websites for personal reference / convenience. With that being said, I'll link relevant stuff in each section for attribution and as a more detailed reference.

#### Timeliness

This guide was created in April 2023, but this type of advice doesn't really change much. So, this stuff will probably stay relevant for a lifetime :)

## Sleeping Well

### Purpose

WIP

## Eating Well

### Purpose

Healthy eating habits are, of course, essential for overall health. Not just what you eat - the timing and amount matters just as much, if not more!

### Calorie & Nutrition Logging

If we just want to stay healthy, we probably don't need to log calories and nutrition. However, if we're trying to build muscle, we should definitely make logging foods a habit - just to make sure we're aware of the ~120 grams of protein needed for optimal muscle growth, and to see how our normal diet compares to that. Also, calorie tracking is essential for losing weight.

See [A Comprehensive Health Tracking Guide](/2023/04/04/a-comprehensive-health-tracking-guide.html) for good calorie and nutrition logging apps. TLDR; Use **Lose It!**.

### Intermittent Fasting

**Do it!** Because intermittent fasting (restricting eating and only drinking water/milk during a 12-16 hour block of time) makes your body use fat as an energy store instead of sugar, it's been proven to lower blood sugar levels, decrease your appetite, and help you lose weight! Even better, small fast times (such as 12 hours) don't require much willpower to start or maintain - the only thing you need to do is fight the urge to eat a midnight snack. This is *super* important, as it makes fasting easier to stick to *and* gives you room to take other initiatives as well.

Here's a good IF (intermittent fasting) plan to follow, assuming a sleep schedule of 12-9 AM each day:

- Start by fasting from **9 PM to 9 AM**. No need to skip any of the 3 meals, but no more late-night snacks :(
- About a week after you're used to this, extend the fast time so it's **9 PM to 11 AM**. In other words, skip breakfast D:
- If you *really* want to go the extra step and you've handled the previous one for about a week, extend the fast time so it's **8 PM to 12 PM**. You'll need to eat lunch later-ish and dinner earlier-ish ;(
- I wouldn't go any further then the above. If you want to (exchanging willpower / risk of deciding to abandon fasting for faster weight loss), you can keep increasing the fasting window, maybe eating 1 large meal per day instead :x

#### Details

How: Start easy with something like a 10 hour fast (basically don't eat during sleep time), and gradually build that up over time. 12-hour fasts are fine for general health. Going up to 16 hours is good for weight loss. Consider condensing your 3 meals - breakfast, lunch, and dinner - into 2 (lunch and dinner). Whatever you do, **avoid midnight snacks**.

Note: "Eating breakfast is good for you" **is a myth**, suggested by studies that failed to consider people with more money and healthier lifestyles (sleep/wake times) would also be more likely to eat breakfast - *not* the other way around, and popularized by cereal brands. There are no health benefits that come *directly* from eating breakfast; the side effects (having to wake up earlier and getting practice sticking to routines) are what cause the benefits.

Fasting for longer periods of time (>16 hours) gives larger beneficial effects but is much harder to do consistently due to hunger, so I'd discourage it unless you're sure you can stick to it without needing to use much willpower.

#### Research

[Eating breakfast won’t help you lose weight, but skipping it might not either - Harvard Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/eating-breakfast-wont-help-you-lose-weight-but-skipping-might-not-either-2019041916457)

[What Happens To Your Body When You Don't Eat (Fast) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Xp8lyxpw9c)

- 12-16 hours: Glycogen (sugar) stores in liver get depleted, body switches to using fat as energy
	- Called ketosis, brings changes in the body
- Fasting works (for most people) where diets have failed

Many people are too sedentary and eat too much sugary, processed foods. The solution is to stop constantly snacking, and eat more healthy foods (veggies, fruits, healthy proteins, whole grains)

- Eating a ton of food before sleep increases your risk of diabetes (due to processed food snacking and eating timing)
- 1 in 7 Americans have diabetes, and 95% of these cases are due to a poor diet and resulting obesity
- Fasting has been shown to help people with type 2 diabetes

Intermittent fasting study: Prediabetics who ate only from 7 AM to 3 PM (16 hour fast) showed a drop in insulin levels, a lower blood pressure, and got used to it / showed a decrease in appetite. Can also decrease weight (if done for long enough)

- It's also important to keep a healthy diet and lifestyle
- Intermittent fasting is a good option if you want to lose weight without much timing and effort.

During intermittent fasting: Drink lots of liquids like milk or water, or exercise!

Fasting for a day or longer can help you lose weight but is also incredibly hard (you will feel very hungry during that time). Also, don't fast if you're pregnant, malnourished, or have a history of eating disorders.

[What If You Don't Eat (Day by Day) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rFIcsi9EVc)

The key thing from this video is that **your body is fine surviving a while without food** (of course, it had to do that in cavemen days), but if you don't gradually expose yourself to this fasting, it will have major consequences on your mood and energy levels.

- What if you fast... forever?
- The important thing to note here is that *your body adapts to how much you eat*. The below ONLY applies if you're not used to fasting for extended amounts of time. If you ease up to a long fast, you'll be able to handle it much better.
- Hunger is your body telling you that it needs more glucose. If you don't answer it, you'll get "hangry" due to hormones causing an irritable mood.
- 1 day after start of fast: Your body feels good at first, but slowly loses the remaining energy reserves it has.
- 2 days (ish): Glucose energy stores are gone, so you enter ketosis, in which you break down carbs and fats for energy instead. Your body might start feeding on itself, starting with fat stores like the abdominal area. You'll lose weight and your BMI decreases. You'll feel tired all the time though. These are actually good things (in a way).
- 3 days: Your body might start reducing the size of your organs too. Your blood pressure drops and your heart rate slows.
- 5 days: You start acting like a wild animal, driven only be the will to survive and get food. Your body starts shutting down non-essential systems.
- Anorexia is an eating disorder causing people to obsess about weight and what they eat. It can lead to multi-day fasts like this. If they go on for too long, starvation will become life threatening without medical intervention.

## Staying Active

This section got too big, so I split it apart into its own separate article. You can find it [here](/2023/04/09/how-to-stay-active.html).
## Maintaining Yourself

### Brain Training

#### Purpose

Ok, so this doesn’t immediately fall into the typical healthy living category. But this is important! This is a method to exercise your brain. Now, according to [this article](https://www.realsimple.com/health/mind-mood/memory/brain-games-exercises), **learning something new every day** has more benefits than brain training games. Also, brain training only has a positive effect if you’re **making mistakes** - this means you’re being challenged, which is what causes growth. But with the right usage, brain training apps do seem to provide a [moderate boost to your brain's abilities](https://connect.mayoclinic.org/blog/take-charge-healthy-aging/newsfeed-post/qa-do-brain-training-apps-work/), although the evidence is still somewhat mixed. Definitely better than playing general video games on your phone though... ;)

So which apps are fun *and* effectively train your brain?

### The Best

#### Peak

Cost: $34.99 per year

This one’s good in all aspects. It’s fun and challenges your brain (hard to level up and play the higher ranks). A great choice for general mobile gaming, instead of... well... you know... Genshin. Or either of the Clash games.

The games are a bit unrealistic - pretty much none of them directly apply to real life - but hey, isn't that the point of gaming? You can always train your brain IRL by going to places or learning new things, but when you want to game... try Peak!

#### What We Considered

##### Neuronation

Cost: $57.99 per year

Fun and *really* challenging! This app is like the midline between fun and relevant to real life. It also trains you at your limit, so it’s a great choice as well.

But. It is quite expensive. Too expensive for its features, I would say.

##### BrainHQ

Cost: $94.99 per year (or $13.99 per month)

Amazing for targeted skill training. Has the best people skills exercises out there (think listening attentively in a conversation, remembering faces and/or facts about people, etc.). Lets you customize your training (not much guidance though) and trains at your limit.

This app is really costly though. You could get this if there's something that really stands out as useful, and it certainly is a useful app. But for me personally, it's out of my price range for a brain training app. :/

##### Elevate

It takes too long to level up in game difficulty, so you’re never really challenging your brain. Plus the review sessions don’t work, because they’re not gamified at all.

##### Lumosity

Games are too plain. The challenge level is decent, but it’s quite expensive ($59.99 per year), and I couldn’t see myself (or really anyone) committing to this app for the long term.

##### Impulse

It’s too plain. Obviously the devs tried to make the games as easy to code as possible. I doubt there is scientific evidence backing this one up. Also the games are too easy and difficulty goes up very slowly.
