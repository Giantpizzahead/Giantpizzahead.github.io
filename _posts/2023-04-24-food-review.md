## Methodology

We'll rate each food, restaurant, or drink item based on how tasty it is, on a scale of 0 to 10 (roughly equal to rating out of 5 stars, multiplied by 2). Each item will also be grouped into a category, for easier comparison with other similar foods. If a food has any important notes concerning health (above or below average compared to other foods in its category), we'll note these down in terms of a caret (+) for healthy, and a question mark (?) for unhealthy. Double carets or asterisks might be used in *very* rare cases. These are in no particular order - probably just when they were reviewed.

This article will likely grow *huge* over time: Jump to sections using the heading links above, or Ctrl-F to search for specific categories and/or foods. Also note that ratings are all very subjective, and most of the time, I'm comparing each food *relative to other foods in the same category*.

## Foods

### Instant Meals

#### [Snapdragon Beef Pho Bowl](https://snapdragonfood.com/products/beef-pho-bowls): 9/10

Amazingly good, considering it's an instant noodle bowl! I'd recommend this over the classics like Maruchan instant noodles. Also has less sodium than other instant noodle options.

#### [Maruchan Beef Flavor Instant Noodles](https://www.maruchan.com/products/instant-lunch/beef-flavor-1/): 7/10?

Tastes pretty good, a welcome variation from chicken flavor (which tbh is the superior flavor). But it's also highly processed with a lot of sodium.

#### [Nongshim Tempura Noodle Udon Big Bowl Soup](https://www.heb.com/product-detail/nongshim-tempura-noodle-udon-big-bowl-soup/2220446): 4/10?

Dries up, is quite salty... I rated it low because there are much better options for instant noodles out there (see Snapdragon).

### Chips

#### [Cape Cod's Kettle Cooked Original Chips](https://www.capecodchips.com/product/original-potato-chips/): 7/10+

Potato chips that are somewhat healthier than the rest, due to being kettle cooked and only using simple ingredients. It'll still make you feel oily afterward though. Also a good bit more firm than other brands, which can be good or bad.

### Veggie Snacks

#### [Annie Chun's Organic Seaweed Snacks (Sea Salt)](https://anniechun.com/products/organic-seaweed-snacks/): 8.5/10+

A nice, light snack to enjoy anytime! Has a good amount of fiber and low calories.

#### [Abound Edamame Dry Roasted With Sea Salt](https://www.cvs.com/shop/gold-emblem-abound-edamame-dry-roasted-with-sea-salt-4-oz-prodid-2490088): 2.5/10+

It doesn't really taste like edamame... I guess it's healthy though :/

### Chocolate

#### [Reese's Peanut Butter Cups](https://shop.hersheys.com/reeses/reeses-peanut-butter-cups/): 9/10

Peanut butter and chocolate are meant to be together. Seriously. Whoever invented this is a genius. For a healthier option, try to get Reese's Thins. Don't go for the dark chocolate version though - the taste difference is pretty big.

#### [Lindor Assorted Chocolate Truffles](https://www.lindtusa.com/assorted-lindor-truffles-20-pc-bag-l000560): 9/10

These. Are. Amazing. Literally. Just get it. The 3-flavor assorted version is the best imo. (Avoid the caramel flavor though.)

## Drinks

### Coconut Water

#### [Vita Coco Coconut Water](https://vitacoco.com/products/coconut-water): 8/10+

It tastes great! I've had some consistency issues, and they do add a bit of extra sugar for taste, but I think it's well worth the many benefits of coconut water. It's a great replacement for other sugary drinks like fruit juice.

## Restaurants
