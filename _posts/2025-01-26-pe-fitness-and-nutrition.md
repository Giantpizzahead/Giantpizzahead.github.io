This course emphasized that wellness is a holistic, multi-dimensional process involving choices that impact our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health. We explored the importance of balanced nutrition, learning to identify whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, while limiting added sugars and processed foods. We were encouraged to make half our plates fruits and vegetables, to drink enough water, and to eat regularly. We also learned to recognize the difference between serving sizes and portion sizes, and how to use the Nutrition Facts label to make informed decisions. We practiced setting SMART goals and explored strategies to eat healthy on a budget. We also focused on the importance of physical activity, monitoring exercise intensity, and the benefits of both aerobic and resistance training. Finally, we learned to manage stress through mindful eating, breathing exercises, and incorporating the "seven essential mental activities" into our daily lives to improve overall wellbeing.

## Outline

Wellness is a holistic process; it's about making choices for a healthier lifestyle, not just the absence of disease. It's multi-dimensional, encompassing our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects. Good nutrition, regular exercise, stress management, and self-worth are key elements.

The course activities were designed to be relevant to our campus life, to help us balance academics, athletics, and personal life, and to support our individual health goals. We learned that improvements in one area of wellness can positively impact others, recognizing that stress, nutrition, sleep, and exercise are all intertwined.

We challenged the idea that wellness is impossible at MIT due to a lack of time. The course aimed to help us find balance between school, sleep, and social life. The concept of energy balance was introduced, explaining that weight management depends on the balance between calories we consume and calories we expend. Finally, we were reminded that our needs are unique, and no one plan will fit everyone.

### 2. The Balanced Plate and Your Wellness Goal

We focused on practical nutrition guidelines and goal setting. The "Balanced Plate" concept was introduced, emphasizing five components: fruits, vegetables, grains, protein, and dairy. MyPlate and Canadaâ€™s Food Guide provided visual models for a balanced meal.

We learned the importance of eating regularly, at least three times a day, for our performance, brain power, and calorie control. We were encouraged to make half our meal fruits and vegetables, and at least half our grains whole. The session emphasized heart-healthy fats, along with choosing beans, nuts, and fish more often. We were also reminded to drink enough water.

We participated in an activity to set a SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Timely) wellness goal. We broke down our goals into actionable steps and considered potential barriers and solutions.

### 3. Introduction to Physical Fitness

[![Image from Gyazo](https://i.gyazo.com/98248d1ca4443a2d2a296bef12039c46.png)](https://gyazo.com/98248d1ca4443a2d2a296bef12039c46)

We learned about the five basic components of physical fitness: aerobic endurance, muscular fitness, flexibility, balance, and functional fitness. We explored our personal motivators and barriers to achieving our physical activity goals.

We measured our resting heart rate and demonstrated proper technique for exercises. We also discussed our daily physical activity with a partner. We learned two ways to increase our daily water consumption.

Physical activity is any movement that uses energy, while exercise is structured, planned, and repetitive activity. We reviewed the benefits of physical activity: improved mood, better sleep, combating chronic diseases, boosted energy levels, weight management, and preserved brainpower. Finding an enjoyable activity and incorporating it into a routine was also emphasized.

### 4. The Importance of Fruits and Vegetables

We focused on the importance of fruits and vegetables and the micronutrients they provide. We explored the health benefits of consuming fruits and vegetables, and identified the specific micronutrients associated with certain ones.

We demonstrated cool-down exercises after a workout, and shared our recommended daily fruit and vegetable intake in small groups. We learned at least one way we could incorporate more fruits and vegetables into our meals. We learned that any increase in fruit and vegetable consumption can have a positive impact on our health. Eating a variety of colors to obtain a wide range of vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals was also emphasized.

### 5. Nutrient Density and Processed Foods

[![Image from Gyazo](https://i.gyazo.com/ca466bda96c64279a8fd433d4e9a8610.png)](https://gyazo.com/ca466bda96c64279a8fd433d4e9a8610)

We defined nutrient density and explored its value in relation to our individual nutrition lifestyles. We identified one way to increase the nutrient density of a favorite food item, and we discussed processed foods and reflected on our personal eating patterns. We explored ways to include more lifestyle physical activity into our day.

Processed foods are foods that have been purposefully changed prior to consumption, ranging from minimally to heavily processed. We learned that minimally processed foods, like bagged greens and frozen vegetables, offer convenience and can be part of healthy meals. Heavily processed foods, like soda, donuts, and candy, often lose nutrients during processing, cost more, and contain added sodium, sugar, and fat.

### 6. Portion Size, Serving Size, and the Nutrition Facts Label

We learned the difference between serving size (a standardized amount of food) and portion size (the amount a person chooses to eat). We explored the value of utilizing the Nutrition Facts label when making food choices.

We were provided with a guide to healthy portion awareness using hand measurements. We reviewed the changes to the Nutrition Facts label, including larger font sizes for calories and serving sizes, updated daily values, and the addition of added sugars, vitamin D, and potassium. We practiced reading and utilizing the label and discussed how it can help us make healthier choices.

### 7. More Whole Grains, Less Added Sugar
We described the three parts of a whole grain: the bran, germ, and endosperm. We highlighted the value of reducing added sugar and making connections to commonly consumed beverages. We practiced identifying whole grain products and discussed our major takeaways regarding added sugar and whole grains. We learned at least two benefits of increasing whole grains and decreasing added sugars for disease risk reduction.

We learned that choosing whole grains, which are high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, can help regulate blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. We were warned against misleading labels on processed grain products. The health effects of excessive sugar intake were reviewed, and we were provided with tips to curb added sugar.

### 8. Lean Protein

We identified accessible sources of lean protein and shared one benefit of consuming lean protein that we valued. We demonstrated resistance training exercises during the physical activity portion of the class, and shared our favorite source of lean protein, and/or barriers and/or strategies to consuming more lean protein at MIT. We reflected on how we can incorporate strength training into our weekly routine.

We learned the importance of protein for various bodily functions, focusing on complete and incomplete proteins. We emphasized choosing lean protein sources that contain little or no saturated fat, and selecting low-fat animal products. We compared the protein content in various foods and learned tips for making wise choices from the protein food group.

### 9. Stress Management and Mindful Eating

We explored the benefits of mindful eating and stress management techniques. We listed three benefits of mindful eating and participated in a mindful eating exercise. We also demonstrated mindfulness exercises and breathing techniques.

We discussed the difference between eustress (positive stress) and distress (negative stress) and identified signals of distress. The "seven essential mental activities" for a healthy mind were introduced: focus time, play time, connecting time, physical time, time in, down time, and sleep time. We also reviewed the practice of mindful eating and the importance of a hunger scale to help us recognize different levels of hunger.

### 10. Choosing Heart Healthy Fats, Identifying Fad Diets
We identified different kinds of fats and their food sources. We explored the value of heart-healthy fats and their benefits, and evaluated internet and social media nutrition claims for accuracy. We shared how we were feeling with each other during the check-in, and applied the Red Flags of Nutrition Fads and Junk Science to our lives and wellness journey.

We explored feasible ways to eat healthfully while at MIT and valued the utility of grocery shopping tips to choose low-cost, nutrient-dense foods. We wrote a letter to our future selves regarding our personal wellness journey, and shared our thoughts on meal planning and grocery shopping with the class. We reflected on our major takeaway from the course and how that connects to our personal wellness journey.

The importance of meal planning was emphasized and we were provided tips for creating grocery lists and making smart choices at the store. We learned strategies for eating well at MIT, including utilizing campus dining halls and local grocery stores. We were also encouraged to reflect on our personal nutrition journey and how to maintain healthy habits.
