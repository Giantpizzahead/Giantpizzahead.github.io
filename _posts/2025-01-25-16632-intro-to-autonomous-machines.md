### 1. Basics of Arduino and Breadboards
- **Sensors:** Output either analog (continuous) or discrete (HIGH/LOW) data.
- **Arduino Basics:**
  - Key functions: `setup()`, `loop()`, `pinMode()`, `digitalRead()`, `digitalWrite()`, `delay()`, `millis()`.
  - Inputs and outputs: Use `INPUT_PULLUP` to reverse signal logic (0 = HIGH, 1 = LOW).
- **Breadboard Overview:**
  - Red (+) columns = 5 V, black (-) columns = ground.
  - Split rows for circuit connections.

### 2. Limit Switches, Serial Communication, and Randomization
- **Limit Switches:** Use `INPUT_PULLUP` for toggling HIGH/LOW states.
- **Serial Communication:**
  - Functions: `Serial.begin(speed)`, `Serial.print()`, and `Serial.println()`.
  - Float precision formatting: `Serial.print(x, 2)`.
- **Random Numbers:**
  - `random(a, b)` generates integers in [a, b-1].
  - Seed with `randomSeed(x)` for varied outputs.

### 3. Analog Sensors and Interpolation
- **Analog Inputs:**
  - Pins A0-A5 for reading sensor voltages.
  - Function: `analogRead(pin)` returns values (0–1023).
- **Sensors:**
  - **Photoresistor:** Resistance decreases with increased light.
  - **Force Sensor:** Resistance changes based on applied force.
- **Data Interpretation:** Use plots and interpolation (e.g., linear) for translating sensor outputs to meaningful values.

### 4. Career Lecture
- **Resume Writing:**
  - Highlight interpersonal, conceptual, and technical skills.
  - Use PAR (Problem, Action, Result) statements for experiences.
  - Coursework and class projects can be included as experiences.
  - Customize the resume with keywords from the job description.
- **Cover Letters:**
  - Personalize using common connections or events you attended.
  - Write a draft yourself before refining with tools like ChatGPT.
- **Career Fair Prep:**
  - Define goals: industries of interest, skills to showcase.
  - Research companies and prepare an elevator pitch with questions.
- **Cold Emailing:**
  - Send a pitch and follow up after 2 weeks if no response.

### 5. Servo Motors and State Machines
- **Servo Motors:**
  - Rotate within 180° or continuously, using three wires (VCC, ground, signal).
  - Controlled via the Arduino Servo library (disables analog pins 9/10).
  - Key functions: `servo.attach(pin)` and `servo.write(position)`.
- **State Machines:**
  - Framework for programming actions based on specific sensor states or values.

### 6. Sensor and Motor Shields
- **Sensor Shield:**
  - Simplifies connections for sensors, servos, and modules to the Arduino.
- **Custom DC Motor Shield:**
  - Used to control front wheels of cars.
  - Utilizes pulse-width modulation (PWM) to adjust analog signals via digital outputs.

### 9. Line Tracking Sensors (nice)
- **Line Tracking Sensor:**
  - Uses an infrared emitter and receiver to differentiate light and dark.
  - Analog output: `0` (black) to `1000` (white); optimal sensor distance is 1–5 cm.
- **Calibration Process:**
  - Place each of the 5 sensors over the black track and record readings.
  - Determine min/max values for each sensor, normalize, and constrain readings to [0, 1].
- **Line Tracking Method:**
  - Black readings = mass of weight `1`; white readings = mass of weight `0`.
  - Use the center of gravity of these masses to estimate line location.

### 10. Bang-Bang Controller and Motor Behavior
- **Bang-Bang Controller:**
  - Simplest controller type (e.g., a heater): toggles on/off based on a setpoint.
- **Motor Observations:**
  - Programmed motor speeds may yield varying RPMs due to external factors.
- **Line Tracking Failures:**
  - Ensure `I_tot` (intensity total) is not zero; add a small bias to prevent loss of signal.

### 12. Bang-Bang vs. PID Controllers
- **Bang-Bang Line Tracking:**
  - Oscillates around a setpoint, requiring significant trial and error.
- **PID Controller:**
  - Uses error between setpoint and sensor value to adjust left and right turn speeds automatically.
  - Separate PID controllers for each wheel (e.g., `KP_left`, `KP_right`).
  - Derivative term can cause "jerky" behavior if tuned incorrectly; it may not always be necessary.

### 13. PID Controller Calibration
- **Calibration Steps:**
  1. Set integral and derivative gains to zero, then adjust proportional gain to match Bang-Bang behavior.
  2. Add derivative gain to prevent overshooting the line.
  3. Add integral gain to prevent slow off-center movement.
- **Debugging:** Adjust the setpoint for testing; the controller should work regardless of the setpoint.

### 16. Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
- **IMU Overview:**
  - Measures roll, pitch, yaw, rotation velocity, and acceleration.
  - Uses the Adafruit sensor library for data reading.
- **Angle Outputs:**
  - Default sensor outputs are in an unconventional orientation.
  - Remap values using the `atan2` function to standardize them to the range `[-π, π]`.

### 19. Interrupt Service Routines and Encoders
- **Interrupt Service Routines (ISR):**
  - Short code segments triggered by interrupts, executed alongside the main program.
- **Incremental Encoders:**
  - Count state changes (HIGH/LOW) for rotation tracking.
  - **Quadrature Method:** Uses two offset sensors detecting magnetic fields in a square wave pattern to determine rotation direction (CW/CCW) and velocity.

### 20. Physics and Non-Blocking Code
- **Physics Calculations:**
  - Distance derived as a function of echo time.
- **Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Code:**
  - Prefer non-blocking code for smoother operation.

### 22. Maze
- **Maze Setup:**
  - Entrance at one of the 4 bottom squares, starting just outside the maze.
  - Exit at one of the 4 top squares, potentially with a small entrance ramp.
	- I combined the A* pathfinding algorithm with an ultrasonic sensor to rock this challenge!

### 23. Mechanics and Materials Review
- **Torque and Moments:**
  - **Definition:** Torque is equivalent to a moment (or couple) in Mechanical Engineering.
  - **Moment Formula:** M = rF, where abs(M) = abs(r) abs(F) sin(phi).
  - Use the **right-hand rule** to determine the direction of the moment vector.

- **Statics Basics:**
  - Statics involves systems with no acceleration; focus is on balancing forces and moments.
  - Tools like CAD SolidWorks or Fusion 360 automate stress calculations; understanding concepts is key.

- **Problem-Solving Tips:**
  - Draw clear and detailed diagrams, similar to physics problems.
  - Moments need to be taken about a specific point to analyze rotational effects.

- **Static Equilibrium:**
  - Conditions: \(\Sigma \vec{F} = 0\), \(\Sigma \vec{M} = 0\).
  - Break moments into components and solve using 6 equations derived from these conditions.
  - Common axes of motion include:
    - **Roll:** Rotation along a table.
    - **Pitch:** Forward/backward tilt.
    - **Yaw:** Spinning on a surface.

- **Loading Conditions:**
  - **Forces:** Point loads.
  - **Distributed Loads:** Force per unit length.
  - Create **free-body diagrams** by abstracting the system into simplified forces and moments.
