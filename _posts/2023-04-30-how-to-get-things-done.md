## Getting What You Want

[How to stop screwing yourself over \| Mel Robbins \| TEDxSF - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp7E973zozc)

- A third of Americans feel dissatisfied with their lives
- Think about what you *really* want
	- Be selfish, don't worry about making it sound good to other people
- **Getting what you want is simple. But not easy.**
	- Whatever you want, there are likely tons of books and/or resources from professionals that teach you the steps to get there
- So why don't you have what you want?
	- Answer: The word "fine" (As in: I'm doing fine)
	- By using the word fine, you don't have to do anything about your situation.
	- You say "I'm fine" to yourself. You've convinced yourself that you're fine not having what you want. AKA you've given up.
- **The odds of you being born: 1 in 400 trillion!**
	- You have life changing ideas for a reason, and it's not to torture yourself.
- Everyone has an "inner snooze button"
	- Most people press snooze as the first decision they make in a day (go back to bed)
- In any area that you want to change: **You are never going to feel like it.**
	- Scientists call this activation energy
- Try this: Tomorrow morning, set your alarm for 30 minutes earlier. When it rings, **throw your sheets off, do NOT hit snooze, and start your day**.
	- Physical force is required to change your behavior.
	- The first 3 seconds of getting out of your warm bed into a cold room suck, then the rest feels great!
- When you become 18, nobody tells you that it's now your job to **parent yourself**.
	- You need to do the shit that you don't want to do.
	- You'll never feel like stopping/doing certain things. Your parents used to force you to do things. Now you need to force yourself.
- How to get what you want: **You need to force yourself**.
- Your brain has two speeds: Autopilot and emergency brake.
	- Anytime you do something that differs from your normal routine causes you to pull the emergency brake.
	- Anything that's a break from your routine will require force.
	- We strive to make routines, then we get bored of them.
- Hierarchy of needs: Your body has basic needs, and is wired to send signals when you don't meet them (think hunger, thirst, lust).
	- When you feel stuck or dissatisfied, it's a signal that your most basic **need for exploration and growth** is not being met.
- **Force yourself out of your head, past your feelings, outside your comfort zone.**
	- Your feelings are screwing you! If you listen to how you feel when it comes to what you want, you won't get it, because you'll never feel like it.
	- Not really taking risks, just getting outside your comfort zone: Doing something you normally wouldn't do.
	- When you had the impulse to do something, but you didn't do the activation energy required to force yourself, your emergency brake got pulled.
- **5 second rule**: If you get an impulse to do something, but don't do some physical act following that impulse within 5 seconds, you kill that idea.
	- Ex: You see somebody that's interesting? Walk over there (within 5 seconds)!

## Procrastination

[The ONLY way to stop procrastinating \| Mel Robbins](https://youtu.be/4x7MkLDGnu8)

- Procrastination is a form of stress relief.
- You are not a procrastinator. **You have a habit of procrastinating.**
- Habits have:
	- A trigger = Stress
	- A pattern you repeat = Avoid doing something
	- A reward = Some stress relief
- Steps to take when you notice the habit of procrastinating:
	- **Acknowledge your stress.**
	- **Count from 5 to 0.**
	- **Work for just 5 minutes.**
- The only way to break this habit is to change the pattern you repeat, since stress will always be there
	- Notice the trigger, count to interrupt the habitual pattern, then just get started on the thing causing you stress.
- Research shows that when you just start, 80% of the time, you'll keep going.
