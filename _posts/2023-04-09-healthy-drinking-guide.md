## Motivation

So of course, water is healthy and sodas aren't. But... why? The purpose of this article is to record the answers to all these "why" questions, so you don't need to re-research it every time.

## Is It Bad For You?

You can actually search for a specific product using this really cool website: [Is It Bad For You?](https://www.isitbadforyou.com/)

I've looked at a bunch of the entries, and some are quite controversial. So I guess I'll leave it up to you if you want to trust their recommendations.

### Things to look at

Zevia - Zero calorie soda

Coconut Milk

## Healthy

### Water

The classic, and probably **the best drinking choice in almost all circumstances**.

The reason water is healthy is simply because it's the only thing people had in ancient days, so our bodies adapted to make full use of it. Of course, if you're looking for something with a little more flavor, you'll need to find another option...

### Sparkling Water (Unflavored)

**It's just as healthy as water.** [Quartz video](https://youtu.be/PrJrq4-Jn4Y)

## Debatable

### Artificial Sweeteners

Many of the drinks in the Debatable category contain **artificial sweeteners** - These are ingredients that give you that sugary taste without adding to the amount of carbohydrates or calories. Essentially, they give you the taste of sugar without actually adding sugar.

As of April 2023, [research is conflicted](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/diet-soda-good-or-bad) on whether these artificial sweeteners are healthy, but to summarize: There is a **correlation** between artificial sweeteners and unhealthy effects like type 2 diabetes or obesity, but there is a lack of proof for *causation*. Considering that people who drink sodas of any kind are generally more likely to have not-so-good eating habits, it's pretty clear that you'd expect a correlation between these. However, that does not imply causation!

There are also a variety of arguments for and against artificial sweeteners directly causing certain things. Some say that the lack of calories makes your body confused (it gets a sweet taste without the calories that usually follow), which *could* make you crave sugar or mess up your metabolism (slow energy usage down). Then again, other studies have found that replacing soda with diet soda might result in weight loss, but these studies likely had conflicts of interest (run by artificial sweetener advocates).

Basically, who knows. It's best to treat these like normal sugar - eat them in moderation, and prefer other options. One such option would be a flavored drink that uses smaller amounts (ideally <1g per fl. oz, so <12g for cans and <17g for bottles) of normal sugar (since you can measure how much sugar exactly is in these).

### Sparkling Water, Artificially Sweetened

For most brands that contain artificial sweeteners (generally stuff that you don't recognize on the ingredient list), it's not as healthy as water, but much better than soda. [Quartz video](https://youtu.be/PrJrq4-Jn4Y)

### Sparkling Ice

This falls under the same category as artificially sweetened sparkling water.

### Zero / Low Sugar Soda

At best, it's similar to flavored sparkling water. At worst, it's just as bad as a regular soda. There isn't enough evidence to support either conclusion, so drink with caution... best to go for one of the healthy options instead.

### Fruit Juice, With Vitamins

In short, **fruit juice is like soda, but with vitamins included**. There are many ways of making it - homemade, cold pressed, from concentrate, artificially sweetened, etc. - and different methods result in different amounts of vitamins being conserved. In particular, *fruit juice from concentrate should be avoided*! The large sugar level stays the same for all juices though. The issue is that the main vitamin in fruit juices - Vitamin C - can be easily obtained through [a variety of fruits and veggies](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-c-foods).

So, in essence, **fruit juice can be fine in lower quantities** (say, 1 glass a day) to get some vitamins... maybe... but **too much can be just as bad as soda** for your health. But look for low sugar options, and make sure the juice actually contains vitamins!

Side note: Talking Point has very high quality documentaries on this type of stuff, with evidence to back it up and entertainment value! We should watch them more often.

## Unhealthy

### Too Much Sugar

Basically all the drinks that are considered unhealthy have too much sugar, whether added or "natural".

### Classic Soda

Of course, this is a very unhealthy option, so **do not drink this routinely (ideally limit to once per week or less). A 12-ounce can of standard soda contains about [39 grams of sugar and 150 calories](https://drinkolipop.com/blogs/digest/switch-to-olipop). That's equivalent to about 9 teaspoons of sugar per can just to put things into perspective.

### Fruit Juice, Without Vitamins

These are essentially sugar water. Just drink soda instead!
