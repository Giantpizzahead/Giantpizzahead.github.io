## Windows
Run Disk Cleanup.

Also use [WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/). Scan the drives, then use the top-right list to choose from different file extensions. Find the biggest files using the directory browser, or click the biggest boxes in the below half. See if you can delete those files, then repeat.

## Mac
Use [Disk Inventory X](https://www.derlien.com/). Usage is similar to the above.
