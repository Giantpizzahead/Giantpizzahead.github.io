There are a *lot* of tools available for pest control... and they might be more effective than you'd think.

## Methods

### Fly Paper

A strip of paper that's bright, gives off a sugary aroma, and is very sticky. The idea is to attract all types of flies to it, and they trap them in the paper - they get stuck to it.

### Growth Regulator

A tool that inhibits the regular growth cycle of insects. Distributed in aerial form. You can use this to stop larva from becoming adults!

## Insects

### Clothing Moths

Looks light brown/tan in color, with 2 wings, not a fly, more like a moth shape (but quite small). Attracted to clothing, specifically anything made out of **wool** (blankets, clothing, etc).
