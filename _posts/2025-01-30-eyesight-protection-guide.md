Here are the most effective strategies to maintain healthy vision:

## Core Protection Strategies

### 20-20-20 Rule
Follow this essential rule: every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break to look at something 20 feet away. This helps reduce eye fatigue and prevents your eyes' focusing ability from locking up.

### Proper Screen Setup
Position your monitor about 60 centimeters away from your eyes, with the screen slightly below eye level. This positioning reduces neck and eye strain while promoting better posture.

### Optimize Display Settings
- Adjust brightness and contrast for comfortable viewing.
- Use night mode when coding in darker environments.
- Consider using blue light filters or specialized computer glasses.

## Workspace Optimization
### Lighting
Use proper lighting that's about half as bright as typical office lighting. Position your screen so windows are to the side rather than in front or behind you to minimize glare.

### Break Schedule
- Take at least one 10-minute break every hour.
- Stop screen activities at least one hour before bedtime.
- Stay hydrated throughout your coding sessions.

## Additional Protection
### Regular Eye Care
- Schedule comprehensive annual eye exams.
- Use artificial tears if your eyes feel dry.
- Make a conscious effort to blink regularly while coding.

### Gaming Considerations
For gaming sessions:

- Limit continuous gaming sessions.
- Use protective eyewear with blue light filters.
- Take longer breaks between extended gaming periods.

## Yan Bao Jian Cao

The Chinese eye exercise technique, properly called "Yan Bao Jian Cao," is a traditional practice implemented nationwide in China to help prevent myopia and reduce eyestrain.

### Exercise Technique
The exercises involve self-massage of acupoints around the eyes, performed with eyes closed, consisting of four main movements:

- Massaging the forehead and eyebrow arch with fingertips
- Pinching the nose bridge with thumb and index finger
- Making circular movements on the cheekbones
- Rubbing with closed fists above and below the eyes

Each movement should be performed for 8 counts, repeated 4 times, with the entire sequence taking about 4 minutes.

### Effectiveness and Considerations
Recent studies show that these exercises may have a modest protective effect against myopia when performed correctly. However, their effectiveness is limited by several factors:

- Approximately 90% of students don't perform the exercises correctly.
- The standard practice time (5 minutes once or twice daily) may be insufficient.
- Incorrect technique (touching your eyes without cleaning your hands) might potentially increase the risk of vision problems.

### Benefits
When performed properly, the exercises can:

- Improve blood circulation around the eyes
- Help relax extra-ocular muscles
- Reduce eye strain
- Provide a structured break from close-up work

For optimal results, the exercises should be performed once in the afternoon and once at night, combined with regular breaks to look at distant objects every 2-3 hours.
