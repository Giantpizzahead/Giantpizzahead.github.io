## Optimal Route
This no longer applies. Use the CSC Go app to choose the best room to go to (ideally 2 free washers).

- Take B elevator (or stairs) from 10th to 7th floor. Check **765** (on the right, same side).
- Take B elevator from 7th to 5th floor. Check **529** (across). No stair access!
- Take B elevator from 5th to 3rd floor. Walk towards A tower (on the left). Check **346** (same side as elevator).
- Take A elevator from 3rd to 8th floor. Check **845** (on the left, across).
- Take A elevator (or stairs *on the left from 845*) from 8th to 6th floor.
- Walk towards C tower (on the left). Check **676** (across from elevator).

To get back to B elevator from 845, take the stairs on the left to the 7th floor, and walk towards B tower.

## About the Rooms
Laundry rooms: 346, 529, 676, 765, and 845
[Very detailed map of Simmons](https://simmons-hall.scripts.mit.edu:444/rooming/)

In terms of how likely each one is to be open, **845 is rarely used**, followed by **346**, **529**, **676**, **765** (from least to most used).

Towers: Left = A, Middle = B, Right = C
A and B towers are connected on the 7th floor, but *not* the C tower. All towers are connected on floors 5 and 6.

Going out of the middle tower elevator, A tower is on the left, C tower is on the right.
