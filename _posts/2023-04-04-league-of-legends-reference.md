Yes, we're really writing this. No, I'm not insane. It's good practice for writing non-serious posts ;)

(Plus winning in League is fun!)

## Pregame Primer

The most important factors for winning a game:

 1. **Avoid dying at all costs.**
 2. **Avoid giving away turret plates if possible.**
 3. That's literally it.

### Details

#### Avoid dying at all costs.

If you die, the enemy gets gold and gets back into the game. When you're ahead, it's better to stay safe and not get kills, because your enemy won't have options to catch back up. Basically, **don't get greedy when you're ahead, and stop feeding when you're behind**.

By extension, every time you die (yes, *every* time), ask yourself: *Why did you die?*

If you have more time - say, a long death and you're feeling like it, or post-game - ask these questions:

 - What did your opponents do right?
 - Could your teammates have played differently?
 - Could *you* have played differently?

It's ok if the answer to these is "they did nothing wrong" or "it was a 3 for 1 so it's cool". Some deaths are fixable, some are justified given the situation and/or your expected level of play. The point is just to help you realize that deaths are often a direct result of your decisions. It also helps you see some patterns that could be leading to your deaths.

#### Avoid giving away turret plates if possible.

I might elaborate more on this later, but for now: Remember that each turret plate is 175 gold, and minions are also worth gold and a lot of experience. Experience is essential in the early game and still very important later on - losing a wave of XP alone is already equivalent to giving away 1 kill. Add on the gold from 1-2 turret plates and the minions themselves, and you're pretty much giving away 2 kills for every wave you let crash without being there.

So don't let the opposing team get free reign on your turrets unless you have a REALLY good reason to (ex: your team is getting baron or dragon and you *have* to be there to secure the objective).
