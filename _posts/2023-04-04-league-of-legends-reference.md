Yes, we're really writing this. No, I'm not insane. It's good practice for writing non-serious posts ;)

(Plus winning in League is fun!)

## Pregame Primer

The most important factors for winning a game:

 1. **Avoid dying at all costs.**
 2. That's literally it.

### Details

#### Avoid dying at all costs.

If you die, the enemy gets gold and gets back into the game. When you're ahead, it's better to stay safe and not get kills, because your enemy won't have options to catch back up. Basically, **don't get greedy when you're ahead, and stop feeding when you're behind**.

By extension, every time you die (yes, *every* time), ask yourself: *Why did you die?*

If you have more time - say, a long death and you're feeling like it, or post-game - ask these questions:

 - What did your opponents do right?
 - Could your teammates have played differently?
 - Could *you* have played differently?

It's ok if the answer to these is "they did nothing wrong" or "it was a 3 for 1 so it's cool". Some deaths are fixable, some are justified given the situation and/or your expected level of play. The point is just to help you realize that deaths are often a direct result of your decisions. It also helps you see some patterns that could be leading to your deaths.

## Ahri
