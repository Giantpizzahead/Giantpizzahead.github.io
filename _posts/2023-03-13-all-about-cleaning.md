### Bath Towels

Wash your towels at least once a week. Make sure to use the "hot" setting on the washer to kill germs more effectively.

It's completely safe (and encouraged!) to reuse the same towel once the next day. It can be ok to reuse the same towel more than once and more than 1 day apart also, but the less time between each use, the better. If the towel smells funky, then don't use it.
