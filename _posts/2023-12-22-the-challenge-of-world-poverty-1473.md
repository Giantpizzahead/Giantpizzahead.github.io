title: '14.73: The Challenge of World Poverty'
---

Summary of the class: The poor are trapped in poverty, not because they aren't trying to make things better, but because they have additional barriers to getting richer that other people don't need to worry about. We can help the poor escape these poverty traps with "big push" policies, and ensure these policies are working through an evidence-based approach with randomized controlled trials.
