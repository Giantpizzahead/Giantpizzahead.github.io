### Day 1: Introduction to Entrepreneurship
- **Goals of StartMIT:**
  - Explore the entrepreneurial mindset and skillset.
  - Build community by connecting with peers, mentors, and speakers.
  - Identify resources like Orbit's digital directory and mentor appointments.

- **Disciplined Entrepreneurship:**
  - Entrepreneurship combines invention (tech/science) with commercialization (business/venture).
  - Two types of ventures:
    - **Small Medium Enterprise (SME):** Local focus, linear growth, short timespan.
    - **Innovation-Driven Enterprise (IDE):** Global focus, exponential growth, long timespan.
  - IDEs emphasize commercialization as much as invention (e.g., iPod vs. MP3 invention).

- **Key Principles:**
  - **Innovation = Invention * Commercialization.**
  - Speed and iteration are crucial—expect initial ideas to be wrong.
  - Entrepreneurship creates antifragile people who thrive in adversity.

- **Debunking Myths:**
  - **Entrepreneurship is a team sport:** Build complementary teams with shared values.
  - **Passion isn't enough:** Obsession drives success.
  - **Risk-taking is calculated:** Successful entrepreneurs mitigate risks with insights.
  - **Charisma isn’t key:** Authentic value and strong products matter.
  - **Luck isn’t everything:** Preparation and recognizing opportunities are essential.
  - **Ideas are secondary:** Focus on solving customer problems.

- **Entrepreneurship Mindset:**
  - Requires "heart, head, hand, and home":
    1. Spirit to embrace being different.
    2. Knowledge from classes and learning.
    3. Capability through practice.
    4. Community to support and grow with.

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - Entrepreneurship is about impact and mindset, not just startups.
  - Embrace challenges and step out of your comfort zone.
  - Focus on learning, innovation, and creating value.


### Day 2: Ideation and Human-Centered Design
- **Ideation Principles:**
  - Ideas come from exploring problems and opportunities, not waiting for a "eureka" moment.
  - Execution matters more than the initial idea; the idea will likely evolve.

- **Idea Generation Techniques:**
  - **Idea Journal:** Use pen and paper to jot down passing thoughts.
  - **Brainstorming:** Focus on quantity, defer judgment, and welcome unusual ideas.
  - **Emotion-Driven Ideas:** Reflect on personal passions, frustrations, and inspirations.
  - **Synectics:** Use "trigger words" to recognize similarities between dissimilar things (e.g., animate, hybridize, distort).

- **Filtering Ideas:**
  - **Personal Filter:** Does the idea excite you and align with your interests?
  - **Business Filter:** Is it a viable business opportunity? Will people pay for it?
  - **External Filter:** Can you gain support and convey the idea to others?
  - **Execution Filter:** Assess risks, competitors, and the feasibility of market adoption.

- **Human-Centered Design:**
  - Entrepreneurs should prioritize understanding user needs and solving meaningful problems.
  - Process involves user research, concept generation, prototyping, and iterative testing.
  - **User Feedback:** Talking to 10 users often provides sufficient qualitative insights.

- **Concept Generation Metrics:**
  - **Fluency:** Number of ideas generated.
  - **Flexibility:** Diversity of the ideas.

- **Common Pitfalls in Ideation:**
  - Sticking to the first idea without exploration.
  - Ignoring competitors and team involvement.
  - Missing opportunities to iterate with users.

- **Creative Prompts:**
  - Use "What if?" scenarios to challenge assumptions and explore wild possibilities.
  - Create **How-Why Diagrams** to identify problems and brainstorm solutions.

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - Ideation requires a mix of creativity, exploration, and filtering.
  - Storytelling is essential for convincing others of your ideas.


### Day 3: Building Teams and Entrepreneurial Relationships
- **Entrepreneurship Teams:**
  - Great teams build great products; 65% of startup failures stem from management issues.
  - **Choosing Co-Founders:**
    - Co-founders with complementary skills and networks improve success.
    - Co-workers are the most stable co-founding relationships; friends may struggle with professionalism.
    - Discuss values, goals, and expectations before committing.
    - Test compatibility through project-based classes or references.

- **Team Dynamics:**
  - Address disagreements by ensuring shared information.
  - Build communication "muscle memory" early.
  - Equity discussions require patience and readiness.

- **Entrepreneurial Relationships:**
  - Relationships are critical; product-market fit alone isn’t enough.
  - **Building Authentic Connections:**
    - Combine confidence (own your story) with authenticity (be real, share behind the scenes).
    - Make connections early, focusing on shared interests rather than transactions.
    - Use storytelling to externalize and shape your personal narrative.

- **Relationship Strategy:**
  - Categorize connections: industry experts, investors, mentors, connectors, kindred spirits.
  - Plan interactions: set a cadence (quarterly, holidays), send updates, and share useful info or referrals.
  - Networking is simply asking for directions.

- **Feedback Best Practices:**
  - Aim to help the receiver genuinely, focusing on observable behaviors, not assumptions.
  - Deliver feedback empathetically; avoid the "sandwich" method.
  - Ideal feedback ratio: 5.6 positive to 1 constructive.

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - Strong teams and relationships are essential to entrepreneurial success.
  - Effective communication and early connections drive long-term impact.


### Day 4: Primary Market Research (PMR) and Customer Understanding
- **Key Principles of PMR:**
  - **Goal:** Understand customers' problems and needs to create products with real value.
  - **Focus:** Don’t sell a solution; instead, identify real problems and opportunities.
  - PMR methods include interviews, immersion, and focus groups (though expensive and less reliable).
  - Early-stage teams (including technical members) should actively engage in PMR.

- **Best Practices for Interviews:**
  - Start with hypotheses to test and define a clear target customer profile:
    - **Demographics:** Age, gender, education, job titles.
    - **Psychographics:** Aspirations, hobbies, fears, values.
    - **Watering Holes:** Gatherings where customers are found.
  - Use open-ended questions like:
    - "Talk me through the last time that happened."
    - "What else have you tried?"
    - "How are you dealing with it now?"
  - Avoid bad questions like:
    - "Do you think it's a good idea?"
    - "Would you buy this product?"
    - "How much would you pay?"
  - Aim for 10-15 interviews to identify patterns.

- **Rules for Effective PMR:**
  - Focus on listening (90% listening, 10% talking).
  - Conduct interviews in pairs or teams to ensure diverse perspectives.
  - Always practice and refine your approach.

- **Optimus Ride Case Study:**
  - Differentiated between end users (vehicle passengers) and buyers (funding providers).
  - Pivoted during COVID to food delivery and tourism to address changing needs.
  - Highlighted market segmentation strategies:
    - Identify specific segments like golf, military, education, or retirement communities.
    - Tailor PMR approaches to each market segment.

- **Applied AI in Customer Relationships:**
  - Test customer relationships using:
    - **Intimacy Test:** Can you anticipate their needs and connect meaningfully?
    - **Godin Test:** Do your products resonate with their deeper motivations?
  - AI can enhance PMR and brainstorming by summarizing customer insights or organizing feedback.

### Day 5: Prototyping and Customer-Centered Communication
- **Interviews and Understanding Customers:**
  - Always introduce yourself and your notetaker; make eye contact.
  - Use a root question and branch out with follow-up questions.
  - Avoid leading questions; focus on customer intent and needs.
  - Practice interviews using tools like ChatGPT for personas or mock interviews.

- **Prototyping to Learn:**
  - Start before you know everything—prototype to uncover unknowns, not to confirm what you already know.
  - Break your product early to identify necessary changes.
  - Development should focus on solving unknowns rather than perfecting known aspects.
  - Types of prototypes:
    - **Learning:** Answer specific questions.
    - **Communication:** Foster discussions.
    - **Integration:** Show how components work together.
    - **Milestones:** Track project progress.
  - Use iterative prototyping to refine ideas.

- **Red Line vs. Green Line Development:**
  - **Red Line:** Focuses on product attributes and reacts to problems as they arise.
  - **Green Line:** Starts with low-cost MVP designs, adding complexity selectively.

- **High-Level Product Specifications:**
  - Visual overview emphasizing benefits rather than technical features.
  - Aligns the team and serves as the foundation for brochures and mockups.

- **Brochures and Mockups:**
  - **Brochure Components:**
    1. Company and product name with tagline.
    2. Visualization (sketch, mockup, or photo).
    3. Benefits targeting top customer priorities.
    4. Clear call to action.
  - Brochures are the fastest, cheapest way to iterate on ideas and test messaging with PMR subjects.
  - Mockups demonstrate potential final designs; use them only when static visuals are insufficient.

- **Design Tips:**
  - Left-align text, use bold headers, and maintain ample whitespace.
  - Follow the 60-30-10 rule for color usage and test contrast for accessibility.

- **Business of Digital Platforms:**
  - Platforms generate value through network effects and solve the "chicken-or-egg" problem.
  - Strategy: Combine innovation platforms (e.g., iPhone) with transaction platforms (e.g., App Store).

### Day 6: Go-To-Market and Entrepreneurial Strategy
- **Go-To-Market (GTM):**
  - **B2C vs. B2B:**
    - **B2C:** Heavy focus on marketing (about 50% of the budget). Early MVPs and initial customers help refine marketing strategies.
    - **B2B:** Direct engagement with small/medium businesses. Longer sales cycle (months to a year) but leads to multimillion-dollar contracts.
  - **Sales Steps:**
    1. **Proof of Concept:** MVP to demonstrate functionality; aim to sell or secure funds during this stage.
    2. **Pilot:** Test the product in real-world scenarios but in limited settings.
  - Start selling as soon as you have mockups or slides (e.g., using a letter of intent).

- **Entrepreneurial Strategy:**
  - Strategy involves choosing among possible paths to create and capture value from an idea.
  - **Example Paths:** Licensing, supplying parts, building communities, or crowdfunding.
  - **Paradox of Entrepreneurship:** Experiments affect the real world, limiting future options if a path is pursued too far.
  
- **Axioms of Strategy:**
  1. **Freedom:** Multiple valid paths to extract value.
  2. **Constraint:** Limited resources or options.
  3. **Uncertainty:** Unknown outcomes from decisions.
  4. **Noisy/Limited Learning:** Tradeoffs in experimentation fidelity and cost.

- **Experimentation Principles:**
  - Ideal experiments balance **criticality** (reducing uncertainty), **fidelity** (accuracy at reasonable cost), and **opportunity cost** (resource/time tradeoff).
  - **Guidelines:**
    - Test small to choose big; learn without full commitment.
    - Focus on reducing uncertainty by testing what matters most.

- **Steps for Strategy Development:**
  - Define target customers, being explicit about those you are not targeting.
  - Explore alternative "beachhead" customer segments for potential pivots.

### Day 7: Startup Financials and Funding Basics
- **Modeling Your Business:**
  - **Key Metrics:**
    - **Bill of Materials (BOM):** Materials needed to create the product.
    - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** Includes labor and direct costs.
    - **Gross Margin:** Sale price minus total direct costs.
  - **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** Total spending divided by the number of customers acquired.
  - **Lifetime Value (LTV):** Average customer lifetime multiplied by annual spending. Aim for LTV/CAC > 3.

- **Business Models:**
  - Recurring revenue models (e.g., subscriptions) are predictable and "sticky."
  - Product-led growth (freemium): Offer free versions to hook customers, then upsell (e.g., Zoom, Spotify).
  - Modern tech businesses often combine revenue models (e.g., ads, subscriptions).

- **Funding a Startup:**
  - **Pre-seed Example:**
    - Valuation: $2M "pre-money."
    - Investor contributes $500K, creating 250,000 new shares at $2/share, resulting in a $2.5M "post-money" valuation.
  - **Stock Options:**
    - Non-founding employees receive options as an incentive.
    - Vesting occurs over time (e.g., 4 years).
    - Option pools (10-25%) are included in pre-money valuations.
  - **Rounds of Funding:** Pre-seed, seed, Series A, B, etc., with follow-on rounds for additional investment.
  - **Preferred Stock:** Investors often receive preference for their investment (money back or percentage of the company).

- **Cold Outreach and Networking:**
  - Cold emails are effective when concise and to the point.
  - Use tools like Google Sheets or CRM platforms to manage connections.
  - Reliability and follow-through are essential.

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - Understand startup metrics (CAC, LTV) and align them with business goals.
  - Choose a funding structure that supports long-term growth and incentivizes employees.
  - Focus on building relationships through clear communication and trustworthiness.

### Day 8: Entrepreneurial Life and Mindset
- **Entrepreneurial Life:**
  - Full of ups and downs—resilience is key.
  - Cold emails may feel awkward but are effective; persistence matters.
  - Success requires constant experimentation and iteration.

- **Entrepreneurship in Organizations:**
  - An entrepreneurial mindset benefits large organizations needing innovation.
  - **Art Analogy:**
    - Startups begin with a blank canvas.
    - Corporations work with a partially completed piece.
  - **Social Entrepreneurship:**
    - Focuses on creating social impact, though it is often more challenging.
  - Sustainability is crucial for organizational success.

### Day 9: New York City Trip
We went to NYC! It was fun, we heard companies talk about entrepreneurship things and toured a startup incubator. :)

### Day 10: Selling Your Vision and Storytelling
- **Selling Your Vision:**
  - Be aware of your audience, message, format, and delivery.
  - Iterate. Your vision stays the same, but your pitch changes all the time.

- **Storytelling Tips:**
	- Keep it simple, laser focus, and make it yours.
	- Pipeline: Intro, email, phone, 1st meeting, 2nd-4th meeting, partner meeting, diligence, lawyers, money.
  1. **Identify the Audience:** Tailor your message to their interests and needs.
  2. **Use a Story Arc:** Build a narrative with a clear beginning, middle, and end.
  3. **Incorporate Emotion:** Engage the audience on a personal level.

### Day 11: Storytelling, Profit & Purpose, and Resources
- **Storytelling for Pitches:**
  - Focus on simplicity and laser-focus your message.
  - Adapt pitches to the audience (investors, customers, recruits).
  - Most critical parts: Strong opening and ending with at most three key points.
  - Use emotional starts and clear asks to make pitches memorable.
  - The goal of each pitch is to secure the next step (e.g., from email to meeting).

- **Rethinking Profit & Purpose:**
  - Align financial profit with societal impact—one can amplify the other.
  - **Value Levers Framework:**
    1. **Products & Services:** Solve real problems customers will pay for.
    2. **Brand:** Build trust to charge a premium.
    3. **Talent:** Motivated teams perform better.
    4. **Operations:** Improve efficiency and decision-making speed.
    5. **Capital:** Greater access to funding as the company grows.
    6. **Policy:** Work ahead of regulations; inform policymakers.

  - **Perspective on Entrepreneurship:**
    - Established companies rarely lead innovation.
    - Entrepreneurship is "irrational" but driven by passion and curiosity.
    - The key is doing, iterating, and learning from experiences.

### Day 12: Final Reflections and Pitches
- **Reflections on Foundership:**
  - Failure is often a prerequisite for success—resilience is critical.
  - Foundership can be lonely but highly rewarding with persistence.
  - Believe in yourself and the value of your ideas.

- **Pitching Tips:**
  - Focus on the product's benefits before briefly discussing technical details.
  - Show your work and explain it enough to build trust and credibility.
  - Key areas of knowledge for success:
    - **AI:** Understanding its capabilities and applications.
    - **Human Behavior:** Insights into psychology and sociology help create impactful products.

Side note: It's freezing during IAP. Not a very fun experience. :)
