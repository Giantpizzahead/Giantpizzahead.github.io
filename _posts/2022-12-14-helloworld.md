Hey, guess what? We got a (very basic) portfolio website! It's based off a template, but who cares - I edited it a lot, and it looks really cool :)

Anyway, there's no actual content here. This post is mainly just to make sure the Posts page isn't empty.

Hopefully we'll find more things to blog about later!
