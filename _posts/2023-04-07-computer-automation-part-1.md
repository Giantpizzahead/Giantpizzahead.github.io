## What is Computer Automation?

I'm defining computer automation as anything that involves writing new computer code to **automatically do things in existing computer programs**. Specifically, this could mean many things, such as:

 - Scheduling a computer shutdown (ex: turn off after 2 hours)
 - Creating a new text file on the Desktop using pure code
 - Opening Notepad, typing some text, then saving the file
 - Using text-to-speech to read out the contents of a Word document
 - Opening Discord's desktop app and reading/responding to unread DMs
 - Searching for the latest fashion trends on Google
 - Completing a basic math course on Khan Academy's website
 - Playing a Coop vs. AI game as mid in League of Legends
 - Streaming yourself playing League in a Discord voice call
 - **Being a "smart chatbot" by doing things that humans do**
	 - Read messages or hear chatter, then react by doing the appropriate things, like replying, searching on Google, opening League and inviting someone else to the party, streaming in Discord, etc.

As you can see, this definition is super broad - the things listed above are ordered from trivial to practically impossible (or is it?). In fact, it can be argued that a lot of existing computer programs do "computer automation" tasks:

 - Mail apps pool all your accounts into one area so you don't have to check each individual one
 - Antivirus apps check all your files for viruses so you don't have to do it manually
 - Window's search feature (on the taskbar) pools a bunch of info into one area, saving you time

And well... I've done a lot of it too in the past. With mixed results. That's what Part 1 of this series of blog posts will cover. In future parts, I'll log my progress on computer automation, hopefully sharing a bunch of cool applications along the way.

Enough introductions. Let's get going!
