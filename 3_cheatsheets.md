<p>There are tons of cheatsheets available online, covering a variety of topics. In addition, almost any programming-related question can be answered by the almighty Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>So, the "cheatsheets" on this website are meant to save time, or to summarize things that are harder to find concrete answers to. To avoid reinventing the wheel, links to external cheatsheets and/or articles are commonly used.</p>

<p>I hope you find them useful! :)</p>
